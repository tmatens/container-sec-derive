// Package tests holds the gadget-level test for advise_filesystem.
//
// SCAFFOLD: mirrors Inspektor Gadget's advise_seccomp unit test, which drives
// the real gadget through the IG gadgetrunner harness and requires that harness
// plus eBPF privileges (CAP_BPF/CAP_PERFMON). It is left as a documented
// skeleton; the pure aggregation is covered host-side by go/advice, and the live
// signal by test/e2e.sh.
//
// The assertion the real harness test must make: a process that writes to
// /dir/file yields an `advise` packet containing "read_only: true" and a tmpfs
// entry for "/dir", and does not list directories that were only read.

# advise_filesystem gadget

An Inspektor Gadget image-based gadget that derives a **read-only root filesystem
+ the `tmpfs:` paths a container actually writes**, by tracing write-intent
`open`/`openat` calls and unioning their directories per container.

Like `advise_capabilities`, this is a csd "Door 2" artifact: the write-path
signal + mechanical aggregation live on IG's extension surface as a self-contained,
signable OCI image. The opinionated half — correlating writes against mounted
volumes (a written path on a volume should stay a volume, not become tmpfs),
confidence grading, and multi-format output — stays in the csd/compose-lint
front-end.

## What it emits

- `files` — raw per-(container, path) map iterator of write-intent opens (mntns
  key + resolved `path` + `count`), flushed on stop. Consumed by the WASM operator.
- `advise` — the k8s `securityContext` field `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` plus a
  neutral `writable_paths:` list of the directories the container wrote to, one
  packet per container. The front-end maps `writable_paths` to Compose `tmpfs:`,
  k8s `emptyDir` volumes, or a persistent volume where a path must survive.

Runtime-setup writes are excluded via ig's container-registration boundary (no
comm-based runtime filter); see the design note in
[`../README.md`](../README.md#design-note-runtime-setup-runc-noise).

## Prior art

IG ships **no** read-only-filesystem/tmpfs advisor and none was ever proposed
(searched issues/PRs: "read-only", "readonly rootfs", "tmpfs advise", "immutable
filesystem" — zero results). It ships the `trace_open` *tracer* this gadget's
eBPF is adapted from. This is greenfield; built to the `advise_seccomp`
conventions for a possible upstream contribution (Door 1) alongside
`advise_capabilities`.

## Build / run

```sh
sudo ig image build gadgets/advise_filesystem -t ghcr.io/<you>/advise_filesystem:0.1.0
sudo ig run ghcr.io/<you>/advise_filesystem:0.1.0 --containername my-app
```

`ig image build` compiles the eBPF + WASM without root; store writes and `ig run`
(eBPF load) need root. See `dev.md`.

## Attribution / licensing

- `program.bpf.c` adapts the openat enter/exit tracing + full-path resolution
  from IG's `trace_open` (GPL-2.0) and the per-mntns aggregation from
  `advise_seccomp`. **GPL-2.0** (GPL-restricted BPF helpers).
- `go/` (WASM operator + `advice` package) is **Apache-2.0**, matching IG.

## Limitations

- Records only write-intent opens that *succeeded*; a path the workload never
  wrote to in the window is invisible (dynamic-observation floor — a signal, not
  a proof; the front-end grades confidence).
- tmpfs is derived at directory granularity from written files. Volume vs tmpfs
  correlation (does a written dir belong to a mount?) is intentionally left to
  the front-end, which can see the container's mounts.
